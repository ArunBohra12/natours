# Intro

Welcome to the Natours app setup guide! Natours is an exciting platform that allows users to explore and book tours to various destinations around the world. Whether you're a passionate traveler looking for your next adventure or an adventurous soul who wants to guide others on their journeys, Natours has something for you.

Our application is divided into two main components: **the frontend and the backend**, having 2 seperate repositories for both of them.

- [Front End Repository](https://github.com/ArunBohra12/natours)
- [Back End Repository](https://github.com/ArunBohra12/natours-backend)

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up both the frontend and backend repositories, ensuring that you have everything you need to get started.
